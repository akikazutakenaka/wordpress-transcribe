/**
 * Core class used to implement HTTP API proxy support.
 *
 * There are caveats to proxy support. It requires that defines be made in the wp-config.php file to
 * enable proxy support. There are also a few filters that plugins can hook into for some of the
 * constants.
 *
 * Please note that only BASIC authentication is supported by most transports.
 * cURL MAY support more methods (such as NTLM authentication) depending on your environment.
 *
 * The constants are as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>WP_PROXY_HOST - Enable proxy support and host for connecting.</li>
 * <li>WP_PROXY_PORT - Proxy port for connection. No default, must be defined.</li>
 * <li>WP_PROXY_USERNAME - Proxy username, if it requires authentication.</li>
 * <li>WP_PROXY_PASSWORD - Proxy password, if it requires authentication.</li>
 * <li>WP_PROXY_BYPASS_HOSTS - Will prevent the hosts in this list from going through the proxy.
 * You do not need to have localhost and the site host in this list, because they will not be passed
 * through the proxy. The list should be presented in a comma separated list, wildcards using * are supported, eg. *.wordpress.org</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * An example can be as seen below.
 *
 *     define('WP_PROXY_HOST', '192.168.84.101');
 *     define('WP_PROXY_PORT', '8080');
 *     define('WP_PROXY_BYPASS_HOSTS', 'localhost, www.example.com, *.wordpress.org');
